#
# Summary:
#     Check if the compiler supports various types of thread-local storage.
#
# Usage:
#     include(CheckThreadLocalStorage)
#     check_thread_local_storage()
#
# Output Variables:
#     waffle_has_tls
#         True if the compiler supports the `__thread` attribute.
#
#     waffle_has_tls_model_initial_exec
#         True if the compiler supports `__attribute__(tls_model("initial-exec"))`.
#

    # this function from returning a false positive in that situation, force
